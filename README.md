# ðŸŒ¿ Hi, Iâ€™m cutelilreno!

A proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community and someone who does tech not for the love of machines, but for the love of people. I hope any skills I have can make things that are helpful for others. <3

I'm a nature-loving, spiritually curious animist. I love meaningful connections and the kind of creativity that excites you â€” whether itâ€™s through code, art, or a well-chosen word. I value clarity, directness, compassion, and creating spaces that help people feel seen, safe, and celebrated.

âœ¨ Be kind. Stay curious. Make magic. ðŸ¦Š
